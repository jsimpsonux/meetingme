## Usage 


Users will be introduced to a portfolio page of the myself. The links in the navbar will help the user scroll down to the corresponding sections. Semantic HTML and grid layouts are used throughout this webpage.

To organise the webpage I used a grid for the 'About', 'Work' and 'Contact' sections so I can control the space between the content and contain the content within containers so I can manipulate the content.

The work section is sorted into another grid within one of the grid containers, the grid is different from the parent grid and tinkering for how many grids/rows will the container span over.
I made the first container take the first row for itself and restrained the other containers to share each row with another container.
